    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Delicious, authentic Dutch butter cake. This cake is moist with a great almond flavor - a favorite in most Dutch households!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon almond extract</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>16 almond halves (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8 inch round cake pans, or 9 inch pie plates.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs, reserving just enough to brush over the tops, about 1 tablespoon. Stir in the almond extract. Combine the flour and baking powder; stir into the batter by hand using a sturdy spoon. The dough will be stiff.</li>
        <li>Press evenly into the two prepared pans. Press almond halves into the top where each slice would be. Brush the tops with a thin layer of the reserved egg.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown. Cut into wedges to serve.</li>
    </ol>
